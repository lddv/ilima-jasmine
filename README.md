=============

A challenge proposed by Igor Lima on his talk at UI Bootcamp. Develop a basic calculator and make tests out of it using Jasmine.

Open the folder that contains both files, the code and the test.

Write on terminal: `jasmine-node <the-spec-file> --color --autotest --watch ./` to watch changes on both files and tell if the test passes or not.
